     It's a RHCP song from the album 'Stadium Arcadium' which happens to be my favorite album (what a surprise).
     The song contains several solo guitars in the back which gives me lots of pleasure while listening to this 
     masterpiece. I really love the climax moment of this song and how it reaches that moment.
