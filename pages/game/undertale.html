       Undertale is a 2015 2D role-playing video game created by American indie developer Toby Fox who is also 
       the composer of the songs of the Undertale. This game really changed my perspective about video games.
       I have even written an essay about this game back in college. The philosophy of the main story is very
       stunning and the game mechanics were very innovative and creative for an indie game, especially a game
       with only one developer.
