    <p>Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983, comprising vocalist Anthony Kiedis, 
        bassist Flea, drummer Chad Smith and guitarist John Frusciante. I really like their style, the punk rock jam they got 
        and crazy lyrics they come up with every single time. They influenced my style, especially their guitarist, John Frusciante.</p>
