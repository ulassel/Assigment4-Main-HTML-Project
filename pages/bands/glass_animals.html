    <p>Glass Animals are an English indie rock band formed in Oxford in 2010. Led by singer, songwriter, and producer Dave Bayley, 
        the group also features his childhood friends Joe Seaward, Ed Irwin-Singer and Drew MacFarlane. They have their own cute
        indie style. They make psychedelic pop which is a new genre for me but I really like their songs and the ambience they have.</p>
